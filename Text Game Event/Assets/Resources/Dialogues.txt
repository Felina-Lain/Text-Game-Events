Twas a good day of training! Soon I shall defeat the dragon!
Days left to train: 
Tis now time to face the beast! I shall pick a weapon and an armor before I go!
You neglected to train in a balanced manner. The Dragon easily spotted your weakness, used it against you and ate you.
You used your superior strenght and warrior skills to cut the head of dragon! You now have a new pair of scaly boots!
You used your magic and intellect to defeat the dragon and made it your pet. It's a very good watchdog.
You used your speed and agility to trick the dragon into killing itself. Even I don't know how you did that one.
Your training was not enough to defeat the dragon, but at least you managed to escape alive. There shall be another occasion.
I cannot add anymore to do or I shall crumble of exhaustion. I shall either change my mind, or finish this day and do another!
